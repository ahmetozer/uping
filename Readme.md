Unidirectional Latency Find Tool  

Determine latency with unidirectional measurements.

This not like run only client side, it is requires server side for measure.

## Server

Avaible server configurations:

- --listen string  
Listen addr for this service (default ":50123")

- --timeserver string  
        Time server which is used for updating time (default "time.cloudflare.com")
- --tsi uint  
        Time sync interval for time client (default 10)

```bash
$ uping server
Server Mode
Time synced, the offset is "365.299Âµs"
```

## Client

Avaible client configurations:

- -c number  
        Ping count
- -i number  
        Ping interval (default 1)
- -p number  
        Remote server custom port number
- -sp number
        Source port number
- --timeserver string  
        Time server which is used for updating time (default "time.cloudflare.com")
- --tsi number
        Time sync interval for time client (default 10)

```bash
uping client 203.0.113.123
Client Mode
Time synced, the offset is "-307.962038ms"
